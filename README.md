## Introduction:
*   This Repo contain the source code of Paper `Deep Learning Bandgaps of topologically Doped Graphene` , it contains all algorithms which we use to predict graphene supercells' bandgap values (Graphene-SVR, VCN, RCN, CCN). Meanwhile it contains the latest data of graphene supercell (4*4: 13018, 5*5: 79647, 6*6: 6382).
